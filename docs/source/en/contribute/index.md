## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions to the SiFli-SDK project, such as bug fixes, new features, documentation additions, etc. You can submit your contributions via [Github Pull Requests](https://github.com/OpenSiFli/SiFli-SDK/pulls).

## Preparation

Before submitting a Pull Request, please check the following points:

- Is the contribution entirely your own work, or has it been obtained with an open-source license compatible with Apache License 2.0? If not, we cannot accept the contribution.
<!-- - Does the code documentation meet the documentation requirements? -->
- Is the code sufficiently commented, making it easier for readers to understand its structure?
- Has the code been formatted using clang-format? Please use the format defined in the `.clang-format` file. For coding style guidelines, refer to [Coding Style](coding_style.md).
- Does the contribution include documentation or examples?
- Are the comments and documentation written in clear English with no spelling or grammatical errors?
- New code examples are welcome contributions.
- If submitting multiple changes, have you grouped all changes by type (each pull request corresponds to one main change)?
- If unsure about any of the above points, feel free to submit a Pull Request and seek feedback from us.

## Pull Request Submission Process

After creating the Pull Request, there may be discussions about the request in the PR comments section.

Once the Pull Request is ready for merging, it will first be merged into our internal Git system for automated testing.

After passing the testing process, your contribution will be merged into the public GitHub repository.
